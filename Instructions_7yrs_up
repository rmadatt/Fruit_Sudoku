**Fruit Sudoku for Kids**

**What is Fruit Sudoku?**
It’s a fun puzzle game with a 9x9 grid (like a big square made of smaller squares). Instead of numbers, we use 9 different fruits: apple 🍎, pear 🍐, orange 🍊, lemon 🍋, watermelon 🍉, grape 🍇, strawberry 🍓, peach 🍑, and cherry 🍒. The goal is to fill every square with a fruit so that no fruit repeats in any row, column, or small 3x3 square.

**Easy Steps to Play:**
1. **Look at the Grid**: The game starts with some squares already filled with fruits. These can’t be changed.
2. **Pick an Empty Square**: Click on an empty square to choose it.
3. **Choose a Fruit**: A box pops up with all 9 fruits. Pick one you think fits. You can also pick “X” to clear the square.
4. **Follow the Rules**:
   - Each row (left to right) can only have one of each fruit.
   - Each column (up to down) can only have one of each fruit.
   - Each small 3x3 square can only have one of each fruit.
5. **Keep Going**: Fill all the empty squares with fruits, making sure you follow the rules.
6. **Check Your Work**: When you think you’re done, click “Check Solution” to see if you got it right!
7. **Start Over**: If you want a new puzzle, click “New Game.”

**Tips**:
- Start with squares that have only a few possible fruits.
- If you’re stuck, try a different fruit or clear the square with “X.”
- Have fun and don’t worry if it takes time—you’re learning!

**Why It’s Fun**: It’s like a fruit puzzle treasure hunt! You get to solve it step by step and feel super smart when you finish.
